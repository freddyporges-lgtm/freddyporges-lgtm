Hi, I'm Freddy Porges 👋 I'm a PM in the ad tech space — supply-side, demand-side, publisher monetization, ad serving. I've built products 0 to 1 at Roku, Uber, and Paypal.

This GitHub exists because I want to level up my PM skills with AI and share what I learn along the way about what works and what doesn't.

You'll find more documentation than polished code here. That's intentional. I care more about showing how I think through a problem than shipping something that looks clean.

Background: Ad tech, programmatic, publisher monetization, 0-to-1 product development

Currently learning: Claude Code, agentic workflows, React, Python, LLM APIs

Day job: Ads Product at PayPal LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/freddyporges
