Hi, I'm Freddy Porges 👋 I'm a PM in the ad tech space — supply-side, demand-side, publisher monetization, ad serving. I've built products 0 to 1 at Roku, Uber, and Paypal.

This GitHub exists because I want to level up my PM skills with AI and share what I learn along the way. I will attempt to document my thought process behind the problems I am solving for and where I inevitably go wrong. This feels very much like I'm going down the rabbit hole and I'm excited to begin!

Background: Ad tech, programmatic, publisher monetization, 0-to-1 product development

Currently learning: Claude Code, agentic workflows, React, Python, LLM APIs, MCP integrations
